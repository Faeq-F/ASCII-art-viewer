# ASCII-art-viewer
An ASCII art viewer that can also compress files using Run Length Encoding

The program was intended to run on windows 10, but it can run on other operating systems

## Instructions:
1. Run the application using the python or exe file
2. Select the option you wish to use in the menu
3. When exiting the application, use the exit button in the menu to ensure data isn't lost during closure

When entering the RLE data, use the Run Length Encoding format so that the sequential characters are represented by 3 characters each;<br><br>
The first two digits are how many times the character is repeated, and the last is the character that is repeated
<br><br>
e.g., 09g = ggggggggg
<br><br>
e.g., 08612402d = 666666444444444444dd

# ASCII-art-viewer
A ASCII art viewer that can also compress the files using Run Length Encoding

The program was intended to run on windows 10 but it can work on other operating systems (though your user experience may be limited)

## Instructions:
When entering the RLE data use the Run Length Encoding format such as the lengths are shown by 3 characters each; first two digits are how long they are and the last is the digit that is repeated e.g. 09g = ggggggggg or 08612402d = 666666444444444444dd

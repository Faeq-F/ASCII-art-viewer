# ASCII-art-viewer
A ASCII art viewer that can also compress the files using Run Length Encoding

The program was intended to run on windows 10 but it can work on other operating systems (though your user experience may be limited)*

## Instructions:
1. Run the application
2. Select the option you wish to use in the menu<br><br>
    When entering the RLE data use the Run Length Encoding format such as the lengths are shown by 3 characters each; first two digits are how long they are and the last is the digit that is repeated e.g. 09g = ggggggggg or 08612402d = 666666444444444444dd
<br><br>
3. When exiting the application, use the exit button in the menu to ensure data isn't lost during closure

*note that this is one of my first full programs written by myself and therefore is old and hasn't been in development for a while. The program is inefficient as a result.
